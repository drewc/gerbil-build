#+TITLE: Building Gerbil Package/Module/Executable[s]

Gerbil is a wonderful Scheme dialect with a very specific module system that can
be used to make and build may things.

How things are built matters. In order to save time and effort we do not want to
rebuild everything each character change. At the same time, we want to be
liberal and not enforce a style or layout upon developers.

This is a simple API for the gerbil equivalent of ~./configure;make;make
install~, or even ~gxpkg install /package/~.

* Install
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Install
  :END:

~gxpkg install github.com/drewc/gerbil-build~

It can be a gxpkg.
